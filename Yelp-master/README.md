# Yelp

Used Yelp API on my custom app to replicate all features of the actual Yelp App. 

## User Stories

The following **required** functionality is completed:

- [x] Table rows for search results should be dynamic height according to the content height.
- [x] Custom cells should have the proper Auto Layout constraints.
- [x] Search bar should be in the navigation bar (doesn't have to expand to show location like the real Yelp app does). )
- [X] Infinite scroll for restaurant results.


## Video Walkthrough

Here's a walkthrough of implemented user stories:
